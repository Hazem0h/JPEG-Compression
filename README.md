# JPEG-Compression
This is an implementation of the JPEG compression algorithm for grayscale images.

In the jupyter notebook, I go step by step in the process of encoding and decoding. The notebook also offers a vectorized implementation of the Discrete Cosing Transform

### Demo: The HD image before compression
<center>
<img src="Original_HD_grayscale.jpeg" width = 400>
</center>

### The image after compression, with 1/10 the original size
<center>
<img src="Compressed_with_specs.jpeg" width=400>
</center>

On my local machine (i7-8550u), the compression takes from 4 to 5 seconds. This is also reported inside the notebook.
